## 🧭 Reading Order

If you are new to the project, read the documents in this order:

1. **[`vision.md`](./vision.md)** — Understand _why_ this project exists.
2. **[`architecture.md`](./architecture.md)** — Understand _how_ the system is built.
3. **[`folder-structure.md`](./folder-structure.md)** — Understand _where_ things live.
4. **[`design-system.md`](./design-system.md)** — Understand _what_ it looks like.
5. **[`ui-system.md`](./ui-system.md)** — Understand the _full UI specification_.
6. **[`component-rules.md`](./component-rules.md)** — Understand _how_ components are built.
7. **[`coding-standards.md`](./coding-standards.md)** — Understand _how_ code is written.
8. **[`optimization-plan.md`](./optimization-plan.md)** — Understand _how_ the site stays fast (95 Lighthouse, 60 FPS).
9. **[`runtime-hydration-fixes.md`](./runtime-hydration-fixes.md)** — Understand development hydration and animation runtime requirements.
10. **[`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md)** — Understand _when_ things ship.

### Page Design Documents

Each page is built around a DevOps metaphor. Read these after the foundational docs to understand the layout, interaction, and component mapping for each surface:

- [`hero-design.md`](./hero-design.md) — Hero section (terminal + portrait)
- [`navigation-design.md`](./navigation-design.md) — Glass navbar & mobile menu
- [`about-page-design.md`](./about-page-design.md) — About as terminal session (`whoami`, `neofetch`)
- [`projects-page-design.md`](./projects-page-design.md) — Projects as container fleet (`docker ps`)
- [`experience-page-design.md`](./experience-page-design.md) — Experience as deployment history (`kubectl`)
- [`skills-page-design.md`](./skills-page-design.md) — Skills as service mesh (`istioctl`)
- [`blog-page-design.md`](./blog-page-design.md) — Blog as systemd journal (`journalctl`)

## 📐 Project Principles

1. **Documentation is code.** Keep these docs in sync with the codebase.
2. **Type safety first.** No `any` types. No unchecked runtime data.
3. **Composition over inheritance.** Build small, reusable, composable units.
4. **Performance is a feature.** Measure before optimizing. Ship fast by default.
5. **Accessibility is non-negotiable.** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum.
6. **Design tokens, not magic numbers.** All values flow from the design system.

---

## 📝 Document Conventions

- All documents use **GitHub-flavored Markdown**.
- File and folder references are written as `code spans` (e.g., `src/components/`).
- Code blocks include the language identifier for syntax highlighting.
- Diagrams use **Mermaid** syntax for renderable, version-controlled visuals.
- Status badges: `✅ Active`, `🔄 In Progress`, `⏳ Planned`, `❌ Deprecated`.

## 🔄 Document Lifecycle

```
Draft → Review → Approved → Published → Maintained
```

- **Draft** — Author is writing. Not ready for review.
- **Review** — Open for feedback from maintainers.
- **Approved** — Signed off by the lead architect.
- **Published** — Linked from this README and considered canonical.
- **Maintained** — Updated as the codebase evolves.

Every document must declare its status at the top.

## 🤝 Contributing to Docs

1. Create a branch: `docs/<topic>-update`.
2. Edit the relevant `.md` file.
3. Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of the document.
4. Submit a PR referencing the change.
5. A maintainer must approve before merge.

> **Rule:** A PR that changes code behavior MUST update the relevant documentation in the same PR.
